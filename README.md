*** An overview of the project.
* This is a Todo List App.
* We can add task and view this task in TaskList page.This task will store in localstorage.
* We can edit any task.we can see properly Updated value in Tasklist page and localstorage.
* We can delete any task.
* Here I have implemented a counter for total tasks and completed tasks.  So after adding tasks, I can see total tasks and completed tasks values.
* Here I addded mark as completed button to each task and if the status of the task is incomplete, then the status will be completed if the mark as completed button is clicked.
* I have added a color for each priority and it can be seen in the priority column of the table on the tasklist page. For the task of low priority I have text-warning, and for the task of medium priority I have text-success and For the task of high priority I have text-danger. All are bootstrap class .
* Here I also implement filtering system based on priority

* To build this website, I am using React.js, React-Bootstrap React Icons, SweetAlert2.
